Hi!, I'm Nick junior coder and gaming pro. This is my site where
you can find out about me and code.
Here's where I learned most of my code. [Codecademy][codecademy]


Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
